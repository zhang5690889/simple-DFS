This is a distributed file system implemeted using GO language

Design

File structure:
- admin.go: Contains main function for automating tests
- client.go: Defines client APIs: get and put
- proxy.go: Contains logic for creating allocation scheme and request redirection
- server.go: Handles storing and retrieving data
- utility.go: Contains types

Features:
1. All communications are using JSON and HTTP
2. Implemented uniform data distribution algorithm
    Example: number of nodes: 3, the value size: 11 bytes, the allocation scheme: [4,3,4].
    The two extra bytes are allocated to two of nodes at random.
3. Automated testing using admin.go

How to run:
In command, type go build && ./HW6 to run the program
